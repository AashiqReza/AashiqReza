Hello! I am Aashiqur Reza.
I am very enthusiastic about data science. I have completed a lot of projects from 2019. I am starting to upload few of my projects on github.

I am very skilled in data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization, predictive modeling and interpretation.

Rstudio is my favourite tool for analyzing data. Besides this, I am also able handle different tools like Python, Excel, Tableau, SPSS, SQL, etc.

I am currently looking for job or research opportunities in the field of data science and analytics.

I hope you would like my codes and find them useful.

Goodday!!
